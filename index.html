Composable Digital Twin Architecture for Supply Chain Redesign
</p>
<p>
Supply chains are undergoing their largest structural redesign in decades,
driven by nearshoring, geopolitical risk, and systemic fragility exposed by COVID.
CatDT provides the missing design layer for this transition.
</p>


  <h2>The problem</h2>
<p>
Most supply chain software was built for optimization within fixed structures.
When networks must be redesigned—across regions, suppliers, and modes—
existing tools become brittle, siloed, and inconsistent across planning,
simulation, and execution.
</p>
<p>
Digital twins exist, but they fail at compositional redesign:
small structural changes require large manual rework and break downstream consistency.
</p>

<h2>What CatDT is</h2>
<p>
CatDT is a design-first digital twin engine for supply chains.
It introduces a compositional architecture that allows supply chain
structures to be assembled, modified, and evaluated modularly,
while preserving consistency across planning, simulation, and execution layers.
</p>
<p>
Rather than replacing enterprise systems, CatDT integrates with them,
acting as a structural design layer above existing tools.
</p>


<h2>Why now</h2>
<p>
Nearshoring and regionalization are forcing companies to redesign supply
chains at a structural level, particularly across the North America corridor.
This shift is not cyclical—it is structural.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, recent advances in modeling and software infrastructure
make compositional system design feasible for the first time.
CatDT sits at the intersection of these two shifts.
</p>

 <h2>Initial focus</h2>
<p>
CatDT initially targets supply chain network design and strategic
planning teams at large operators and industrial firms undergoing
multi-region supply chain redesign.
</p>

    <h2>Status</h2>
<p>
CatDT is an early-stage product developed by DCat Technologies.
The project is founder-led and currently engaging with industry
contacts and early partners for exploratory discussions and pilot definition.
</p>

    <h2>Founder</h2>
<p>
CatDT is founded by Juan Orendain, a mathematician and systems theorist
with experience in compositional modeling, large-scale system design,
and cross-disciplinary research at the intersection of mathematics,
physics, and applied systems.
